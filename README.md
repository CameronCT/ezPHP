# ezPHP v1.0
ezPHP is a learning project that was inspired by the infamous [SmartyPHP](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty) except utilizing the .phtml  files instead of .tpl as well as hoping to make a faster framework than Smarty.

## Getting Started
We've added a `examples` folder so you can easily get started with your new project!
